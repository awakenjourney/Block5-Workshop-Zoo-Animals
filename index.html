            Bears are mammals that belong to the family Ursidae. They can be as
            small as four feet long and about 60 pounds (the sun bear) to as big
            as eight feet long and more than a thousand pounds (the polar bear).
            They’re found throughout North America, South America, Europe, and
            Asia. They have nonretractable claws, short tails, and excellent
            sense of smell. <br />
            <br />

            They’re typically solitary, except for mothers with cubs. There are
            eight species: Asiatic black bears (also called moon bears), brown
            bears (which include grizzly bears), giant pandas, North American
            black bears, polar bears, sloth bears, spectacled bears (also called
            Andean bears), and sun bears. <br />
            <br />

            On average, bears can live up to 25 years in the wild and 50 in
            captivity. Six species, including the polar bear and the giant
            panda, are included on the IUCN Red List as threatened or
            vulnerable.

            Giraffes grow about 4 feet (1.2 meters) in their first year of life.
            A newborn giraffe is about 6 feet (1.9 meters) tall at birth and
            weighs about 150 pounds (68 kilograms).<br /><br />
            Many young giraffes, called calves, die from lion attacks during
            their first year of life. Once a giraffe reaches adulthood its
            height is often enough to protect it from lions. Adult giraffes,
            however, must still be careful of lions when they are bending down
            to drink water or rest. Usually giraffes will drink or rest in
            shifts so that at least one giraffe is always on the lookout for
            approaching predators.​

        <p>
          For all of their roaring, growling, and ferociousness, lions are
          family animals and truly social in their own communities. They usually
          live in groups of 15 or more animals called prides.<br /><br />
          Lion prides can be as small as 3 or as big as 40 animals. In a pride,
          lions hunt prey, raise cubs, and defend their territory together. In
          prides the females do most of the hunting and cub rearing. Usually all
          the lionesses in the pride are related—mothers, daughters,
          grandmothers, and sisters.<br /><br />

        <p>
          Monkeys are clever, social animals. They are known for running and
          leaping through trees with ease. Like apes and humans, monkeys belong
          to the group of mammals called primates. <br /><br />

          Monkeys look somewhat like apes such as chimpanzees, orangutans, and
          gorillas. But monkeys differ from apes in several ways. For instance,
          every monkey has a tail, even if it is just a tiny nub. Apes do not
          have tails. Monkeys also generally have narrower chests than apes do.
          <br /><br />

          There are about 200 species, or types, of monkey. Scientists divide
          them into two groups, Old World monkeys and New World monkeys. Old
          World monkeys include baboons, drills, mandrills, macaques, guenons,
          langurs, and colobus monkeys. Among the New World monkeys are
          marmosets, tamarins, howler monkeys, spider monkeys, squirrel monkeys,
          woolly monkeys, and capuchins.

        <p>
          Alligators are large lizardlike animals with long, rounded snouts and
          powerful tails. They spend most of their time in the water, but they
          also travel on land. Alligators belong to the group of animals called
          reptiles. They are related to crocodiles.
